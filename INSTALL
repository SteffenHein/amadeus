--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Copy the package file amadeus-<version>.tgz into your home directory 
   [ or whereever you want to create the initial installation directory ~/amadeus ].
   In the following, that directory is referred to as 'build directory'.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Unpack the amadeus package, using the tar command

	tar -xvzf amadeus-<version>.tgz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Edit your [ operating system dependent ] makefile and define your  
   preferred program installation path [ viz. the directory /~ wherein the
   executable program amadeus.do shall reside ].
   Write that directory into Makefile as macro AMD_INST=/~. Take care that
   the directory lies on the default search path of your user environment
   [ usually defined in the .login, .profile, or the .bash_profile script ],
   or include that directory into your search path.
   Within Makefile, you may also configure your preferred C compiler options
   by modifying AMD_CC and the pertinent flag, AMD_FLAG, in the 
   desired fashion [ usually it is recommended to use optimization options, 
   in particular for computationally expensive subroutines and functions ].
   Copy your configured makefile into the file named 'Makefile' or
   set a symbolic link, for instance [ if your makefile is makefile.unx in a 
   UNIX type operating system ], by entering the command:

         ln -s makefile.unx Makefile

   Note that the pre-configured makefiles [ makefile.gnu, makefile.unx ]
   added to this package use GNU Make [ or CMake ] syntax.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Edit the CONFIG.H header file and reconfigure, if necessary or wanted, the
   pertinent array dimensions [ macros ], always complying with the needs of
   your application. The CONFIG.H file usually resides in the directory

                            ~/amadeus/.. 

   where ~/ denotes the build directory. With the default makefiles
   CONFIG.H is expected to reside in this directory at compilation time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Before compiling the sources, you should in addition specify your preferred 
   editor and line printer options at the top of the CONFIG.H script.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Compile and install the executable program directly into an indicated
   directory [ AMADEUS_INST in Makefile ] by entering the command

        make install

   or into any intermediate directory AMADEUS_PATH [ specified in
   Makefile ] by doing a

        make amadeus.do

   In the latter case, you may individually move the compiled executable
   program [ amadeus.do ] into any other directory, where you like to 
   install it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Finally you can do a

	make clean

   in order to remove all binary objects from the build directory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Change into your home directory or wherever you want to run your 
   applications [ for instance ~/amadeus/work ] and start the 
   executable program with the command

        amadeus.do

   If your installation is OK, a text console opens asking your running options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Note that the numerical output is saved in GNUPLOT compatible format.

Thanks for using AMADEUS
